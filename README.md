### Code and manuscript for EM–MaxEnt IRL methods to infer delays and strategic behaviour in Limit Order Books.



We present a complete mathematical, algorithmic, and empirical framework for analyzing high-frequency Limit Order Books (LOBs) by modelling them as asynchronous games with delayed states and actions, and employing Inverse Delayed Reinforcement Learning (IDRL) to infer trader strategies executed under unknown and heterogeneous latencies.


Building on the theory of asynchronous decision processes, we introduce a Time-Bracketed EM–MaxEnt IRL formulation that jointly estimates (i) probabilistic state–action responsibilities across delay windows, (ii) latent strategic mixtures governing trader behaviour, and (iii) reward parameters for multiple strategy types.


> **Status:** This is an active research project. The manuscript and codebase are undergoing final proofreading, validation, and faculty peer-review before the formal preprint release.
